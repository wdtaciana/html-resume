<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Taciana Pessoa, I’m Brazilian, and I have a degree in Languages with a focus on Spanish. I’ve always been passionate about learning and exploring new fields, which led me to dive into the world of programming. I’ve been studying this area intensively and striving to improve and grow every day.

  
<p>In addition to technology, I’m an avid reader, enjoy creating crochet projects, and love expanding my knowledge in all aspects of life. I also share my days with Maya, my Border Collie and best friend, who brings endless joy and inspiration to my life.

<p>This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, the challenges I’ve embraced, and the skills I’ve developed. I hope you enjoy exploring my projects as much as I enjoyed creating them!</p>
